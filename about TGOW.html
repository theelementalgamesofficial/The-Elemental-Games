      <h2>Last Night</h2>
      <div class="hover-reveal">
        <p>The westernmost state-settlement of Northern Erenia, also the last to be founded. Based entirely within the Rallies, originally developed as a bunkerland to house all the populations of Erenia. After the cross-country split, it became a working base for the Northern Erenian Council leaders, with the understanding between the two countries that in case of a major calamity, any and all Erenians would be given refuge in the Bunkerland if needed. This circumstance never came to pass, although LN was raided once by Southern Erenian rogues during the 1003 AB famine (The Southerner government was ordered to pay damages immediately; this was considered the general catalyst to further raids across Northern Erenia from Southern Erenia, who believed mistakenly that all Northern states were as well stacked as the LN bunker.) </p>
        <p>The Rallies were created by one of the many Musan bombs. While in some places it caused the lands to later turn fertile (i.e Charred Mountains) this did not happen in LN. Population zero most times of the year.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Marathas</h2>
      <div class="hover-reveal">
        <p>Settlement in Asia, ethnically even more varied than either of the Erenias. Major Rusi, Europan and Afric populations since the intersettlemental war (a story for another time). A monarchy-oligarchy, with their king working in tandem with several heads of ministries; at the time of the last update given to the Erenians by the Marathas, they were absolute enemies of the Farscas with no end to the enmity in sight.</p>
        <p>They control the waters of earth and most trade across Earth; their trades - spices, crops and infomation - are coveted all across the world.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Farscas</h2>
      <div class="hover-reveal">
        <p>The other Asiatic settlement, slightly less ethnically varied than the Maratha Empire. Surprisingly hostile to external contact, and almost entirely isolated ever since their conception. They hate the Marathas quite as vehemently as the reverse. A pure democracy with every decision made by the public. This does not always go well. </p>
        <p>They are as honor bound to their words as all the other settlements. This irks the Marathas, who could have otherwise turned both Erenias against the Farscas using the laws of the new world.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Afshur</h2>
      <div class="hover-reveal">
        <p>Effective zombies. Side effects of the Musan bombs, perhaps intended effects; the nanotech that killed the adults when released from the bomb then takes over the body of the human and controls it like a suit, hijacking the brain's inbuilt nervous center of communications to use the whole body with bypassed biological limits.</p>
        <p>The nanotech seeks to control as many bodies as it can, but cannot survive outside a human body for too long after it joins one in the first place.</p>
