    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>
First, my family - from parents to siblings, cousins to grandparents. Each of you has built this world, whether you know it or not!
    </p>
    <p>
Second, Meraki. The most loyal, cleverest and most supportive critique partner EVER! You have made the books what they are now - without you, would there be any fire in The Game of Fire, any ice in The Game of Water?
    </p>
Third, all my English teachers. Yes, all of them! You were the ones who taught me how to share my world with everyone; without you, I wouldn't have the words to bring to life The Elemental Games. 
    </p>
    </p>
Fourth, Reber; the original Robin. Nerd extraordinaire and my rational half, you have kept the series alive and grounded. You brought the Games to the The Elemental Games - the reality to my unreality. 
    </p>
    </p>
And last but not least, all of you who have ever trusted in me, for you are the foundations which all my worlds are built upon!
    </p>
    <p>
May Ra-Hathor bless you all.

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      Satvik M. Bhure was born in 2010 and has been captivated by the art of storytelling for as long as he can remember. With a boundless imagination and a deep-rooted love for fantasy, he began writing at the age of ten, penning his first novel in secret during online classes.

Satvik doesn’t write for romance or adrenaline, nor for cliché morals or explosive battle scenes. He writes for something quieter, something often overlooked - the soul of the story. His work is shaped not by spectacle, but by stillness: the sway of a maple leaf growing from an oak, the fleeting connection between two strangers who may never cross paths again.

For Satvik, writing isn’t about chasing fame or preaching lessons. It’s about reminding us that heroism doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it simply shows up—willing to face the fight, even when no one’s watching. He writes to show that while a soldier at the frontier is brave, the medic who comforts the fallen is braver. That grace may lie in dying silently — but humanity lies in dying loudly, screaming in pain, if it means saving someone else. </p>

    <p>
     For to die human is the greatest victory of all.
